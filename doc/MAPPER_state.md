TTK Developer Experience
========================

This document summarises the state of a work: coding the mapper module.
This work was began (and a lot was done) by Pierre Guillou, and I finished it.


## Already implemented
Everything apart finalising the examples.
At some point we tried some other projection for the segmentation, but this was slow and not so interesting.

## Still TODO
Finalise the examples
Merge commits, remove error messages.

Some buckets are empty, hence generating non existing centro√Øds. What to do with them?
Remove some? We said not good, because the i-th bucket does not have the values we would think it has.
